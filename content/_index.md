## Who am I ?

Hello there ! I'm Evann, a 20 years old IT engineer student at INP-ENSEEIHT (Toulouse).
Passionate about computers and science in general, I first did a two-year degree in Biology, Modeling and Data Analysis ([BioMAD](https://albm.fr/)). It was these two years that made me realize my passion for computing.
Between personal projects, course projects and the professional projects I carried out in this field, it became clear to me that ENSEEIHT was the school that would satisfy my growing desire to do computer science.

Like any good IT student, I've been using and loving the Linux operating system for nearly 3 years now (I use Arch btw). 

This appetence led me to train independently in several fields. I learned to program in various languages: HTML, Python and TypeScript, ..., as well as to handle different tools to facilitate development and production such as Docker, Poetry, Yarn, GitHub ... This is what allowed me to contribute to different open source projects, including a web application for students but also to create this website. I also have for principle to do the maxium for each project, while avoiding as much as possible the "dirty code".

All my projects are said to be "Open Source" and accessible to all on my GitHub profile.
