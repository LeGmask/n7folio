# Some profiles that inspire me: 

## [Alexandre Kempf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandre-kempf-7aab53109/)

I've met Alexandre at the Interpromotional Exchange Day for my bachelor's degree. His career path has inspired me a lot, and his work at [@Lixo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lixo-technologies/) where fighting for the environment with the help of computer tools (artificial intelligence) particularly appeals to me as these are strong values for me.

## [Benoît Morgan](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/beno%C3%AEt-morgan-83b6a256/)

Also interested in cyber security, I recently took a TLS-SEC course during one of my free hours. Presented by Mr Morgan, I quickly got hooked and was fascinated by his courses and more specifically by his career which has led him to Intel.

## [Elie-Julien El Hachem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elie-julien-el-hachem/)

First my machine leaning teacher, then the tutor of my [long project](https://github.com/LeGmask/COVID_cyTOF) group in which we created a neural network in order to identify the markers enabling a pation to be classified as covid positive or not. Mr El Hachem made me want to continue with computer science and why not do a thesis in the future.
