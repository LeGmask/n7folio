During my first week at ENSEEIHT in September, I had the opportunity to attend a thought-provoking theatre experience called "Le Procès de King Kong. This interactive spectacle encouraged us to question our own attitudes and reflect on the impact of our behaviors towards others. Through open dialogue and collective responsibility, we were invited to reconsider societal norms and strive for a more respectful and inclusive environment. The show provided valuable insights into the complexities of sexist and sexual violence, shedding light on prevention and healing. It was a powerful reminder of our individual and collective roles in shaping a more equal society.
