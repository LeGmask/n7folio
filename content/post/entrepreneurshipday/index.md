At Enseeiht's Entrepreneurship Day, my team and I presented Neurosphère - a revolutionary technology creating immersive experiences for all, regardless of physical limitations. With investors like Tahles and Google, we planned our market entry within the next 10 years, focusing on technological perfection and customer connection.

Our competitive pricing strategy includes offering Neurosphère for less than €1700 and a virtual world subscription for under €100/year. Our commitment is to make this groundbreaking technology not only revolutionary but also accessible to all.

Setting ourselves apart with cutting-edge tech and an open-source approach, we're redefining industry standards. Join Neurosphère and reinvent reality with your mind control and sensory immersion! (Neurosphère = augmented reality headset)
