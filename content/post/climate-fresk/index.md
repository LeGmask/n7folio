I have always been aware of the impact human activities have on our planet, especially with my biology background. However, attending a Climate Fresk workshop was an eye-opening experience that brought the reality of climate change closer to me.

Climate Fresk is an interactive and engaging way to learn about the complexities of climate change through a game. Participants are invited to create their own "climate village" using cards representing various industries, natural resources, and green technologies. The goal is to build a sustainable future while balancing economic growth and environmental concerns.

During the workshop, I was struck by the interconnectedness of all aspects of our society and how they contribute to climate change. It was a humbling reminder that every action we take has an impact, no matter how small.

As I left the workshop, I felt a sense of responsibility to make a difference in my own way. I realized that I could start by making simple changes at home, such as reducing energy consumption and using reusable bags. These actions may seem insignificant on their own, but they are an important step towards creating a more sustainable future for all.
