Co-creator, with Hayleia, of ShoutBot, a Discord and Ti-Planet bot to link the official Discord server and the site's chat. 

This bot is a rewrite of an existing project, but as it was not very maintainable, and my code was relatively rough, so with Hayleia we decided to start a total rewrite.

ShoutBot offers an evolved version: more powerful and with more features. For example: latex support on the Discord side, self-bot use (continue to post messages related to your account).
