Mapping *(creates tracks)* in Trackmania is great, but why not share this experience with the excellent community of this game? Grand-2, is an improved version of a very old project, which had for objectives to allow players to map with several players.

The API of the map editor being too incomplete (see the following [post](https://forum.maniaplanet.com/viewtopic.php?f=279&t=46381&p=310337#p310337)) it was impossible to make a version adapted to the general public with the current version of ManiaPlanet. So I decided to stop the project.
